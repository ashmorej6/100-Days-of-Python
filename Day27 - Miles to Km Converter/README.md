# Day 27 - Miles to Kilometers Converter (Tkinter)

Today I built a simple GUI application using Tkinter that converts miles to kilometers.

## What I Learned
- How to create a basic user interface using Tkinter.
- How to use `Entry`, `Label`, and `Button` widgets.
- How to retrieve and process user input from an entry field.
- How to update labels dynamically based on input and logic.
- How to handle invalid user input using `try` and `except`.
- How to structure small GUI programs in Python.
