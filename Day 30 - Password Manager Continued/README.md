# Day 30 - Password Manager with JSON (Tkinter)

Today I improved the password manager app by adding functionality to save and retrieve password data using a JSON file format.

## What I Learned
- How to use the `json` module to store and retrieve structured data.
- How to read from and write to JSON files safely using `try`, `except`, and `finally`.
- How to update existing JSON data without overwriting the entire file.
- How to implement a search function to retrieve stored credentials by website.
- How to validate input and display error or confirmation dialogs with `messagebox`.
- How to build more advanced logic and data handling into a Tkinter GUI app.
