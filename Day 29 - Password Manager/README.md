# Day 29 - Password Manager (Tkinter)

Today I built a basic password manager application using Tkinter that allows users to generate and store secure passwords.

## What I Learned
- How to generate random, secure passwords using the `random` and `string` modules.
- How to use the clipboard with `pyperclip` to copy generated passwords.
- How to read from and write to a local text file for basic data storage.
- How to validate user input and display warning dialogs using `messagebox`.
- How to organize and structure GUI layouts with `grid()` in Tkinter.
- How to build a more functional GUI application with multiple inputs, buttons, and pop-up messages.
