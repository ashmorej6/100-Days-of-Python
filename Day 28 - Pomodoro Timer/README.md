# Day 28 - Pomodoro Timer (Tkinter)

Today I built a Pomodoro Timer using Tkinter to help manage focused work sessions and breaks based on the Pomodoro Technique.

## What I Learned
- How to use `after()` to schedule recurring functions in a Tkinter app without freezing the UI.
- How to implement a countdown timer using recursion.
- How to manage state and control flow between work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks.
- How to update GUI elements like labels and canvas text dynamically.
- How to use global variables effectively in a small-scale project.
- How to use emojis or symbols to visually track completed work sessions.
