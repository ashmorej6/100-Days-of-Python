# Days 20 & 21 - Snake Game

## What I Learned

### Day 20:
- How to use OOP to model game elements (e.g., Snake as a class).
- How to create multiple `Turtle` instances as snake segments.
- How to move segments in sequence to simulate slithering.
- How to use `onkey()` and `listen()` for real-time arrow key controls.
- How to use `time.sleep()` for frame timing.

### Day 21:
- How to create a `Food` class using `turtle.Turtle`.
- How to detect collision between the snake and food.
- How to extend the snake by adding segments.
- How to generate food at random positions.
- Basic collision detection using distance checks.
