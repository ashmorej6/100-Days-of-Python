# Day 23 - Turtle Crossing Game

As I had accidentally deleted the source folder for this project (I did a cleanup of my downloads folder and hadn't moved the turtle crossing files into
my pycharm folder) I had to go back and redo this project.
I actually found that it helped my learning to do it again from scratch a few days later and was able to add a .txt file to save and recall an overall highscore.

## What I Learned

- How to use classes to manage game entities like the player and cars.
- How to detect collisions between the player and moving obstacles.
- How to generate multiple car objects at random positions.
- How to control the player turtle with keyboard input.
- How to implement a level-up mechanic when the player reaches the top.
